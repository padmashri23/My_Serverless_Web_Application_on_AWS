# My_Serverless_Web_Application_on_AWS
building a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB and S3.

STEPS TO BUILD:
Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). 
Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency.
Create a DynamoDB table to store the items. 
Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table. 

THE EXPERIENCE I RECEIVED:
Serverless web application hosted on AWS using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront. Additionally, gained experience working with AWS services and integrating them to build a complete solution.
